    "The first thing you want to do after installing python and VSCode successfully is to open VSCode. <br>\n",
    "In the side pane you can see several symbols. Click on the \"Extensions\" button and search for ***Python***. <br>\n",
    "You want to install the one created by Microsoft. Once you've done that, you can create a new folder<br>\n",
    "on your desktop for example. You can name it however you want but it might be best to give it a simple <br>\n",
    "name like ***App***. In the next step you want to open your folder in VSCode. Do that by clicking <br>\n",
    "\"file > open folder\" and select your folder. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue using the VSCode terminal, we need to set the default terminal to *cmd*. <br>\n",
    "We can do that by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + P</kbd> and typing ***terminal select default profile***. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "``python -m venv myvenv``\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "``.\\myvenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat``\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check in the terminal if your virtual environment is activated or not. If the command worked and <br>\n",

    "#### Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plan on working more often on your project, it may be useful to consider setting your newly created <br>\n",
    "virtual environment as default for this project. To do this, press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and type in *python* <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "It should only take a few seconds and it's done. Just as we did with Flask, we now want to check if it was <br>\n",
