    "\n",
    "The first thing you want to do after installing python and VSCode successfully is to open VSCode. <br>\n",
    "In the side pane you can see several symbols. Click on the \"Extensions\" button and search for **Python**. <br>\n",
    "You want to install the one created by Microsoft. Once you've done that, you can create a new folder<br>\n",
    "on your desktop for example. You can name it however you want but it might be best to give it a simple <br>\n",
    "name like **App**. In the next step you want to open your folder in VSCode. Do that by clicking <br>\n",
    "\"file > open folder\" and select your folder. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we continue using the VSCode terminal, we need to set the default terminal to *cmd*. <br>\n",
    "We can do that by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + P</kbd> and typing ***terminal select default profile***. <br>\n",
    "Then you select Command Prompt. Now you want to create a new terminal by clicking <br>\n",
    "\"terminal > new terminal\" and type in:\n",
    "\n",
    "``python -m venv myvenv``\n",
    "\n",
    "By pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> we create a new virtual environment in the folder \"myvenv\". Since that is the name <br>\n",
    "of the folder, you can give your folder a different name if you like. But for now lets continue with that. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we want to activate the virtual environment. We will do this by typing the following in the terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "``.\\myvenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat``\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check in the terminal if your virtual environment is activated or not. If the command worked and <br>\n",
    "successfully activated your virtual environment, you should see (myvenv) at the start of your terminal line. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plan on working more often on your project, it may be useful to consider setting your newly created <br>\n",
    "virtual environment as default for this project. To do this, press <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> and type in *python* <br>\n",
    "*select interpreter*. You will already see recommendations pop up. Now you want to click on the option that has <br>\n",
    "the name of your virtual environment in it ((myvenv) in this case). \n",
    "\n",
    "You can now create a new terminal by clicking *Terminal* and *New Terminal* in the navigation bar of VSCode. <br>\n",
    "If it worked correctly the terminal line should start with (myvenv).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "Still in the same terminal (starting with (myvenv)), you can now install flask by simply tiping the following\n",
    "\n",
    "``pip install flask``\n",
    "\n",
    "You should something happening in your terminal and after a few seconds flask is installed. If not sure <br> \n",
    "whether it is installed correctly or not, you may check your folder in the explorer. Your folder should <br>\n",
    "contain ***flask***. It may look something like this (It's only a screenshot of the top of the folder, <br> \n",
    "not showing ***jinja2*** for example)\n",
    "\n",
    "![Screenshot of the folder!](/images/Folder.jpg \"Project Folder\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Upgrade Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "It may be useful to check if you have installed the newest version of Flask. If you want to upgrade Flask, <br>\n",
    "type this in your terminal line.\n",
    "\n",
    "``pip install --upgrade flask``\n",
    "\n",
    "### Install Flask-Marshmallow\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the previous step where we installed Flask, we now want to install Flask-Marshmallow by typing <br>\n",
    "one simple command as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "``pip install flask-marshmallow``\n",
    "\n",
    "It should only take a few seconds and it's done. Just as we did with Flask, we now want to check if it was <br>\n",
