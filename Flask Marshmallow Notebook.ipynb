    "The first thing you want to do after installing python and VSCode successfully is to open VSCode. <br>\n",

    "You want to install the one created by Microsoft. Once you've done that, you can create a new folder<br>\n",
    "on your desktop for example. You can name it however you want but it might be best to give it a simple <br>\n",

    "Before we continue using the VSCode terminal, we need to set the default terminal to *cmd*. <br>\n",
    "We can do that by pressing <kbd>Ctrl + Shift + P</kbd> and typing ***terminal select default profile***. <br>\n",

    "\n",
    "``python -m venv myvenv``\n",

    "\n",
    "``.\\myvenv\\Scripts\\activate.bat``\n",
    "\n",
    "You can check in the terminal if your virtual environment is activated or not. If the command worked and <br>\n",

    "#### Optional\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plan on working more often on your project, it may be useful to consider setting your newly created <br>\n",
